===================
*** Indivisible ***
===================
A parallelized prime number generator written in C. It uses a bignum
library as well as OpenMPI for parallelization.

# Building
----------
## Dependencies
The dependencies for compiling are minimal, and should be available
on most UNIX-like systems:
 - GNU Make
 - GNU Multi-Precision Arithmetics Library (GMP)
 - OpenMPI C wrapper compiler (mpicc)

## Compiling
To compile you simply need to run the `make` command, which will
create the `indivisible` binary file. Additionally you can set the
following flags by appending them to the `make` command:
 - `DEBUG=<1|0>`: whether to create a debug or release build. (0 by
   default)
 - `PREFIX=<path>`: what base prefix to install the binaries at.
   (`/usr/local` by default)
