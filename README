===================
Indivisible is a parallelized prime number generator written in C.

# Building
----------
There are multiple dependencies to install before compiling the project:

 - CMake build system
 - GNU Multi-Precision Arithmetics Library

Once the dependencies are installed you can compile by running the following
from the root directory of the project:

  cd build/
  cmake ..
  make

This will create a release build, to build with debug options append the
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug' flag to the `cmake' command.
