Change Log
==========

- v0.1: Initial release
	- Basic prime calculation.
	- Uses a growing vector of known primes and gets the modulus of the number divided by these primes.
	- Uses type `long long' to hold prime numbers.
- v0.2: Multi-Precision
	- Switch to C.
	- Uses GNU Multiple Precision library (GMP) to hold prime numbers, allowing for 'infinite' size.
	- Add `likely()' and `unlikely()' macros to optimize.
- v0.2.1: Memory Leak Fixes
	- Fixed a major memory leak at the end of the program.
	- Added more optimizers.
- v0.3: Optimizations
	- Algorithm skips half the known primes.
	- Removed `likely()' and `unlikely()' macros due to lack of information.
	- Improved performance.
